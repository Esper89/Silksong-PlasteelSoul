Plasteel Soul lets you access Steel Soul-exclusive game content outside of Steel Soul mode.

## Installation

This mod requires
[BepInEx 5](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Silksong), and is
installed to your `BepInEx/plugins` directory.
[Configuration
Manager](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/Yukikaco/BepinExConfigurationManager)
can be used with this mod.

## Usage

Once this mod is installed, by default, you will be able to access all Steel Soul-exclusive game
content through various means. Specifically, in non-Steel Soul mode,

- Steel Seer Zi is accessible in the same location in the Blasted Steps and offers the same _A
  Vassal Lost_ wish as she does in Steel Soul mode. The Summoned Saviour boss fight is identical and
  the rewarded Growstone functions normally.
- The Shell Satchel can be purchased from Jubilana in Songclave for 290 rosaries after completing
  the _The Lost Merchant_ wish.
- Skynx is accessible in the same location east of Styx's nest in Sinner's Road, and continues to
  provide rosaries in exchange for Silkeaters. Styx is alive and well regardless.
- The Chrome Bell Lacquer can be applied to your Bellhome. You can still choose the White Bell
  Lacquer instead.

Each of these features can be disabled by editing this mod's config file at
`BepInEx/config/Esper89.PlasteelSoul.cfg` or using Configuration Manager.

## Languages

This mod adds new text to the game. If your language is not supported by this mod, you can add
support for it yourself by copying `languages/en.json` to `languages/xx.json` (where `xx` is your
language's lowercase two-letter code) and translating all of the text.
